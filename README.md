# CryptoSwift AES Issue Sample

This sample code was made for CryptoSwift [issue #610](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift/issues/610). This was originally made for version 0.9.0, but there's a new `master-0.10.0` branch to cater the new version, too.

## Requirements

- Xcode 9.3 or up
- Carthage

## How to run

- Run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS`. Add `--no-use-binaries` if it fails.
- Open `CryptoSwiftAESIssue.xcodeproj`.
- Run the sample app in Simulator.
